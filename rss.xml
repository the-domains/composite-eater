            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The European Abalone</h1><p>If you're not from Europe, the chances are that it will seem strange to you that I've put a "green ormer" tag to what obviously looks like abalone. Well, this is just a precise way of describing Haliotis tuberculata, the European representative of the Haliotidae family. To be honest, I did not expect to find it on this side of the Atlantic either. But as soon as I've spotted the characteristic half shells at my fishmonger's stand this morning, I knew that they'll land on my plate today.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1265f8fe-b848-4fc8-b8cd-bfd999065040.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Butchers.</h1><p>I don't like killing. There is no pride in ending the life of anything or anybody. It's no fun either, although staying out in the cold for hours waiting for that wild boar to go on a midnight stroll by the moon instills that special feeling. A poet would call it a connection with the original human. He would call upon the blood and the god-like decisions about the life and death. I'm sorry, I'm not a poet.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f4b53243-807b-4853-b93b-e14005569e47.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Pasta!</h1><p>Some people bring wine and cheese from their visits to Italy. Some bring pasta, the one spotted last-minute in the obscure airport shops, maybe accompanied by some chocolates and other sweets, especially if the part of Italy in question is sufficiently close to the Swiss/Austrian border. I am guilty as well - I bought a whole can of Ricola's sugar cubes.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/17e19d72-ed27-41c8-a233-2a16859e358d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Culinary hide and seek]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Culinary hide and seek</h1><p>After a warm winter full of carrots, potatoes, apples, pears and more apples, the spring has finally come to Compiègne, Picardie, France. But it took it's time, no worries, apparently. As in 2012, the so-called "spring months" had temperatures comparable with those on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Suddenly, I wasn't sure if I'm in France or back in Montréal. But at last, the sun, though still somewhat shy, has encouraged me past Saturday to replenish the provisions, maintained at a bare survival level, due to some voyages (in search of the sun, besides of other goals).</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dfeb6f8a-47fb-42b0-885e-fb55e8efd789.jpg"></article>]]></description>
