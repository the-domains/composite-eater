            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Butchers.</h1><p>I don't like killing. There is no pride in ending the life of anything or anybody. It's no fun either, although staying out in the cold for hours waiting for that wild boar to go on a midnight stroll by the moon instills that special feeling. A poet would call it a connection with the original human. He would call upon the blood and the god-like decisions about the life and death. I'm sorry, I'm not a poet.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f4b53243-807b-4853-b93b-e14005569e47.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The European Abalone]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The European Abalone</h1><p>If you're not from Europe, the chances are that it will seem strange to you that I've put a "green ormer" tag to what obviously looks like abalone. Well, this is just a precise way of describing Haliotis tuberculata, the European representative of the Haliotidae family. To be honest, I did not expect to find it on this side of the Atlantic either. But as soon as I've spotted the characteristic half shells at my fishmonger's stand this morning, I knew that they'll land on my plate today.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1265f8fe-b848-4fc8-b8cd-bfd999065040.jpg"></article>]]></description>
