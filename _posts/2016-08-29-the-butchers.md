# The Butchers.

I don't like killing. There is no pride in ending the life of anything or anybody. It's no fun either, although staying out in the cold for hours waiting for that wild boar to go on a midnight stroll by the moon instills that special feeling. A poet would call it a connection with the original human. He would call upon the blood and the god-like decisions about the life and death. I'm sorry, I'm not a poet.

Full story unravels after clicking on the carnage.

All I can see is hauling the gutted beast through the night to put it in a burlap sack in the back of a pickup. You hang it in the cooler and the next day after school (yeah, those were the days) you have a knife in your hand while attending Dr. Tulp's life anatomy lesson. Rembrandt, as usual, was very economical with color, but it's true - flaying and quartering the _Sus Scrofa_ is not a bloodbath. It's a very clean and precise operation, where you thrive to maximize the yield while keeping an eye on the residual lead. Either this, or you'll break your teeth on a sausage later. A happy pig becomes a happy sirloin steak garnished with onions in a matter of hours.

Now, the militant vegans and vegetarians will definitely accuse me of cruelty here: "You're killing an animal!" Yes, I am. But not for fun. Each and every European farmer would say that "reducing the wild boar population" is a necessity. There's a lot of them, and they destroy (grain & vegetable) crops. But despite the hunting, their population prospers because they are mostly feeding on human thrash.  
And there goes: we kill food to protect other food, while the first food feeds on the food we discard because we can't eat all of it. Vicious circle? No. Lack of respect.

In a way, if it wasn't for the humans' appetite for beef and pork, the cow and pig population would never ascend to the heights it has. The bad part is that this <<cow, pig, sheep, ...\>\> usually doesn't lead a very happy life. Worst, if it ends up in a cellophane-wrapped styrofoam box in a supermarket. This complete disconnection from the real world, that virtualization of food by taking it out of the context is the main cause of the problem.

If you talk to your butcher, anywhere in the world, he'll tell you about his animals. Probably, with a smile, especially if they roamed on a plain, feeding on grass instead of being stuck in a box, getting stuffed with granulate. The butcher I've met recently on Crete was really proud of his pigs, and you were sure they led a happy life once you've tasted those ribs braised in wine. Good food is born of good food, and the air of the island spoke for itself. In my personal experience, no plastic wrap was ever able to convey such taste.

On the market in 西安, there was none of such cheerfulness, but surely my language skills had a role to play in here too. Flies roamed in hordes over the stands featuring each and every part of an animal. However, one thing was certain: nothing went to waste.

The stories could go on, Brazilian beef barbecue, flying Charolaise in Montréal, le boudin from Pierrefonds. The closer you get to the story behind the animals, the more you respect them in your plate, usually the quality of the story being correlated with the taste. And if you are a bit interested in what was the life of that cow, you will probably care a bit more if some "evil industrialist" decides to invade its habitat.

The bottom line here is this: being carnivore is a choice. We can live without meat the same way as we can live without cars, computers, soap and whatever you choose. Anything that is manufactured, crafted or farmed is followed by changes in the environment, i.e., death or prosperity of those or other animals. Chemically synthesized proteins? C'mon, the name contains it already. I prefer to kill, eat from nose to tail and have no styrofoam trash to throw out. Nothing disgusts me more than the photoshopped breaded burgers from the freezer. Maybe the global massacre in fish fingers...
