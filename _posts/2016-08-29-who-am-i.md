# Who am I?

I'm an engineer in materials science and advanced mechanics with a specialty in composite materials. In lay terms, this means a constant paranoia about everything around, what is it composed of, how has it been made and how it fits with the rest of the picture. Incidentally, I'm also a musician, a fan of visual arts and food aficionado.
