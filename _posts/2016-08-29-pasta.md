# Pasta!

Some people bring wine and cheese from their visits to Italy. Some bring pasta, the one spotted last-minute in the obscure airport shops, maybe accompanied by some chocolates and other sweets, especially if the part of Italy in question is sufficiently close to the Swiss/Austrian border. I am guilty as well - I bought a whole can of Ricola's sugar cubes.

But apart from this "instant throat cure", my bag was full of a white substance carefully wrapped, so not to waste a milligram. A finely ground white powder that can give you such gustatory pleasures if only managed with careand used in precisely measured quantities.

I am talking about _farina di grano tenero_. Flour.

The doppio zero "00" ground yields a silky, delicate dough, easy to work and form. Additionally, this northern variety of _Triticum aestivum_ contains less protein than the typical bread wheat or durum. The result: less liquid is absorbed and at the same time, dough is flexible and extensible, meaning that your arms will not die of exhaustion in the pasta making frenzy. Add some fresh eggs from the march√© and despite the usual Picardian monsoon, you'll have a taste of Lombardian sun.
