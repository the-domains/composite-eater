If you're not from Europe, the chances are that it will seem strange to you that I've put a "green ormer" tag to what obviously looks like abalone. Well, this is just a precise way of describing _Haliotis tuberculata_, the European representative of the _Haliotidae_ family. To be honest, I did not expect to find it on this side of the Atlantic either. But as soon as I've spotted the characteristic half shells at my fishmonger's stand this morning, I knew that they'll land on my plate today.

If it weren't for commercial farming, most probably abalones in general would have joined the legendary New York oysters due to the serious appetite of gourmands from California, South Africa, Australia and Japan. European ormers are farmed at the coasts of Bretagne in northern France, e.g., at Phare de l'île Vierge (http://www.francehaliotis.com/index.html), not that far away from Brest. After three to five years of serene existence and algae diet, they were taken out from marine depths and just 24 hours later flexed their muscles in the chill of the Picardian morning.

What came next? Well, the knife of course. And the mallet. And only then the hot oil and butter. The ormers are mollusks, and the edible part consists of the muscle they use to take a stroll in your fridge (joking - just keep them cool and moist). It is a strong piece of meat that needs to be tenderized with a mallet prior to sautéeing in a smoking hot pan.

The keyword of the whole operation is moderation. Not too much tenderizing - you want your ormer steak to be tender and not ripped. Not too much sautéeing - one minute on one side and maximum one on the other or it will come out as tough as the soles of biker's shoes (the tough ones, for choppers). Not too much garnishing either: a pinch of sel gris, three turns of the pepper mill and two spoons of crème fraîche to balance the acidity of sorrel. This way the delicate taste of the Atlantic will linger, especially if accompanied with a light young Chablis.
