description: >-
  Not that long time ago I was watching Gordon Ramsey’s journey in the Indochina
  and especially how he struggled to prepare soup in the morning rush of the Cái
  Răng floating market, in Cần Thơ in the Mekong Delta. I didn't expect to see
  and taste it in real just a couple of months later. Full documentary on the
  visit to Vietnam is to be published shortly.
