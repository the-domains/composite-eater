# Culinary hide and seek

After a warm winter full of carrots, potatoes, apples, pears and more apples, the spring has finally come to Compiègne, Picardie, France. But it took it's time, no worries, apparently. As in 2012, the so-called "spring months" had temperatures comparable with those on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Suddenly, I wasn't sure if I'm in France or back in Montréal. But at last, the sun, though still somewhat shy, has encouraged me past Saturday to replenish the provisions, maintained at a bare survival level, due to some voyages (in search of the sun, besides of other goals).

Please feel free to amuse yourself in finding some of the more and less fresh arrivals from the Picardian terroir. May I say, that the colinot (European hake, Merluccius merluccius), was especially fresh, simply put in the oven for a slight roast and devoured with oven-hot baguette drowning in extra vergine. What will the next Saturday bring?
